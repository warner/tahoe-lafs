* plan:
** DONE port viz-d3 to current trunk
** DONE add misc-events (frontend should switch on presence of .misc in data)
** add ?data=URL
***  build server to render pre-generated datasets
***  tell people about it, show them how to save datasets
***  add misc-event to /down-N/timeline?misc=true , maybe
** add summary timing (AES, zfec, waiting, fetching) back to list page
** clamp zoom/pan to avoid negatives
** make SVG fill page, add y-scrolling
** glue axis to bottom and top of page
*** consider scrolling block() requests in a separate region, so
    read/segment/misc events can be seen at the same time as arbitrary block
    requests.
*** consider color-coded list of shares/servers used, clicking on one can
    vertical-scroll the block() region to that section
** determine why blockreads for second share don't appear to happen before
   first share's blockreads have returned
   - sometimes. Maybe there's actually just a lot of computation happening
     before sending out the first blockreads. That computation could be moved
     up, before the DHYB responses return, at least the blockhashtree part.
     (the sharehashtree part depends upon which shnum we end up using). Find
     a way to measure and display it.
   - on a 13MB file on my laptop grid, the first blockread was sent 14ms
     after the first DYHB response
   - on a 1MB file, that delay was 5ms
     - maybe just the kernel giving time to the other 9 servers, need more
       realistic hardware and slower/longer pipes to really test it
*** processing time *is* significant, sometimes knowledge of a better server
    arrives *before* we send multiple-blockreads-per-server, but yet somehow
    it's too late to avoid it.
**** reduce requests and loops
     - generic way to avoid leap-before-look is to merge Share.loop()-type
       calls (get all the responses that are pending before taking any
       action), and to combine as many requests as possible (to reduce the
       number of things that need merging)
** add data-is-fetching/data-is-rendering spinner
** find way to make zoom/pan faster with lots of elements but when most are
   off-screen (probably winnowing dataset to overlapping events)
** record timestamps on server too, return in a bundle after download
   finishes, add to timeline. Actually accumulate them in the BucketReader


* #1264 speedup attempts
** get trace of atlasperf LAN k=60, analyze for slowdowns
*** wow that's a lot of reads
*** I see too many satisfy/desire calls, but it's probably correct, one per
    share per segment (not one per read span returned). Each one takes about
    1.2ms to process.
*** need to count total read calls
*** sending each read call (on an odd segnum, one read per share) seems to
    take about 12.5ms per share. On segnum16, the individual read calls (8
    small, one large) take about 1ms each. Wow, that's a lot of cycles..
    what's taking so long?
** reducing number of reads by fetching whole hash tree at once
*** I think old-downloader took a shortcut and downloaded the entire hash
    tree, instead of asking for just the necessary pieces
*** changing new-downloader to do the same reduces 10MB/k=60 from 48s to 39s
    - increases memory footprint, O(filesize) (actually 2*32*2*numsegs)
      versus O(ln(filesize))
    - actually the test was invalid: the #1170 fix meant I was re-fetching
      the whole hash tree on each segment. Removing that fix makes it 33s.
    - actually still invalid. Better fix is to only add whole tree to want_it
      when segnum==0 (since adding it each time causes desire/requested code
      to re-fetch all the used parts over again). Still 33s.
    - actually still not right. looks like it's still fetching lots of small
      spans. Current patch looks like

** add immutable-share readv API, see if it improves speed
***  find a way to fake/remove specific potential slowdowns and measure results
     like replace foolscap fetch with pre-fetched RAM
     (copy whole share into ram, fetch spans from ram)
** measure WAN speeds, see if k matters

** implement HTTP-based readv, see if reduced marshalling helps

* bugs
** DONE scroll events fail on FF5 (work on Chrome)
   - both scroll-up and scroll-down cause zoom-in
   - scroll-up should be zoom-in, -down should be zoom-out
   - fixed in d3-v2.0.0, maybe v2.2.0
** DONE some rules get left on screen
** DONE range of x() changes, ticks narrow to only part of width
** tooltips (title=) fails on chrome, works on FF
** tooltips don't trigger when hovering on text, only on rect
   - maybe draw rect over text? maybe draw invisible rect over both?
* new features
** should clip text to size of rect, to avoid overlap
   - look at svg:clipPath, or svg:mask
** add zoom/unzoom +/- buttons
*** get buttons to work with drag-based pan+zoom
    - mouse clicks are firing two actions: button click and pan
    - I suspect they're happening reentrantly, and the pan is undoing the
      zoom
*** make zoom/unzoom buttons float above rest of chart
*** add zoom/unzoom slider
** add landscape (like in d3/examples/zoom/, calls it "context view")
   - want decimated dataset
   - just use read() and segment() sections
** double-click on box should zoom to make that box 80% of width
*** pan/zoom currently uses double-click to mean "zoom in"
*** need to distinguish between 2click-on-bar and 2click-on-background
** add misc-events, show Coalesce patch is working
*** measure overhead of misc-events, consider whether to enable or not
** BIG: live data update, incremental. Server-Sent Events (FF6)

* d3 current: v2.2.0
** I was working with v1.29.1 before
** hm, d3.behavior.js is gone .. now in d3.js? yes, same import name though
** fixed firefox mousewheel zoom
** d3 v2.0.0 moved 'axis' into core (from d3.chart), looks handy for tickmarks
   xAxis = d3.svg.axis .scale(x) .tickSize(-4)
   major ticks, minor ticks, tickFormat, orient=top/bottom/left/right, .scale,
   svg.append("svg:g").attr("transform", "translate(0,h)").call(xAxis)
** stringifies numbers for uniqueness, but stores original
   (probably no longer necessary to stringify myself)
** remember svg origin is top-left, so y=d3.scale.linear().range([h,0])



* layout
** read() requests
   - possibly overlapping: code should find minimum number of rows
** segment events (request/delivery/error)
   - also possibly overlapping, use minimum rows
   - might be nice to show which is active at any given time
** DYHB queries+responses
   - completely overlapping, use exactly one row per server
** server block-read requests (send/receive/error)
   - use one cluster per server
   - lots of overlapping reads
   - within a cluster, use lowest available row
   - 3-tuple Y axis: (serverid, shnum, overlaps)
** ideally, tahoe should serve raw data and let JS do the sorting
   - but my JS is not that good
   - maybe just provide a hint: include a row number in each event, which
     tells you how to overlap them
   - multiple parts, joined with "-", use as JS dict keys

* a graph that shows Y=segment-offset, X=start/finish time
* a scatter plot that shows segnum-tree-height versus finish-start
  - a local download showed segments that needed a lot of hash nodes taking
    way more time than others

* misc-events:
  - process_block
  - decode
  - crypttext_hash_tree.set_hashes ("CThash")
  - satisfy/desire
  - check-desire
  - AES
* zoom
  my notes say: To zoom to [0s:1s]:
  - globals.x.domain([0,1.0])
  - globals.redraw()
