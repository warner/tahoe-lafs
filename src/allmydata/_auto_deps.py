# Note: please minimize imports in this file. In particular, do not import
# any module from Tahoe-LAFS or its dependencies, and do not import any

# always available, or the import is protected by try...except ImportError.

# The semantics for requirement specs changed incompatibly in setuptools 8,
# which now follows PEP 440. The requirements used in this file must be valid
# under both the old and new semantics. That can be achieved by limiting
# requirement specs to one of the following forms:
#
#   * >= X, <= Y where X < Y
#   * >= X, != Y, != Z, ... where X < Y < Z...
#
# (In addition, check_requirement in allmydata/__init__.py only supports
# >=, <= and != operators.)
